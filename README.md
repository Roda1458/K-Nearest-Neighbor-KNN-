# K-NN Classifier Implementation

## Introduction

K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) is a simple, yet powerful, supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. The core idea of K-NN is based on the concept of "closeness" or similarity. 

### Theory

- **Basic Principle**: K-NN classifies a data point based on the majority class among its K nearest neighbors in the feature space. The distance metric used to determine the "nearness" can be various forms, such as Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, or Minkowski distance.

- **Parameter K**: The parameter K represents the number of nearest neighbors to consider when making a classification decision. For instance, if K=3, the algorithm looks at the three closest data points to the query instance and assigns the class label that appears most frequently among these neighbors.

- **Distance Metrics**: The choice of distance metric can significantly impact the performance of the K-NN algorithm. Commonly used metrics include:
  - **Euclidean Distance**: The straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space.
  - **Manhattan Distance**: The sum of the absolute differences of their coordinates.
  - **Minkowski Distance**: A generalization of both Euclidean and Manhattan distances.

- **Choosing K**: The value of K affects the algorithm's performance. A small K can make the model sensitive to noise in the data, while a large K can smooth out the decision boundary, potentially leading to underfitting. The optimal K is typically determined through cross-validation.

- **Advantages**:
  - **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and implement.
  - **No Training Phase**: K-NN is an instance-based learning algorithm, meaning it does not require a training phase. The computation happens during the prediction phase.

- **Disadvantages**:
  - **Computational Complexity**: As the dataset grows, the time required for classification increases since it involves computing the distance between the query instance and all training instances.
  - **Storage**: Requires storing the entire training dataset, which can be memory-intensive.

## Steps

### 1. Load the Dataset

Select a dataset suitable for classification tasks. This dataset should contain features and a target label for classification. Ensure that the dataset is cleaned and preprocessed as necessary before using it for training and testing.

### 2. Split the Dataset

Divide the dataset into two parts:
- **Training Set**: Used to train the K-NN classifier.
- **Test Set**: Used to evaluate the performance of the classifier.

Typically, a common split ratio is 80% for training and 20% for testing, but this can vary depending on the dataset and specific needs.

### 3. Test the Model

After training the K-NN classifier with the training set, evaluate its performance using the test set. Key performance metrics include:
- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total instances in the test set.
- **Confusion Matrix**: A matrix that shows the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

### 4. Analyze the Effect of K

To find the optimal value of K, evaluate the model's performance for different values of K. Plot a curve of "K vs Accuracy" to visualize how changing K affects the classifier's performance. Identify the value of K that yields the highest accuracy on the test set.

## Files and Structure

- **dataset.csv**: The dataset file used for classification.
- **knn_classifier.py**: The Python script implementing the K-NN classifier.
- **results_analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for analyzing the performance and plotting the "K vs Accuracy" curve.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

## Usage

1. **Load the dataset** into your script or notebook.
2. **Preprocess the data** as required (e.g., normalization, handling missing values).
3. **Split the data** into training and test sets.
4. **Train the K-NN classifier** on the training set.
5. **Evaluate the classifier** using the test set by calculating accuracy and the confusion matrix.
6. **Analyze the effect of K** on performance by varying K, plotting the accuracy curve, and identifying the optimal K.
